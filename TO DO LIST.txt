Theme: Repair
General Idea: Knight fantasy world repair things after dragon destruction

Gameplay Idea:
1) City has health, dragon will attack after a set amount of time
2) Dragon is attacking while you fixing city, 0% health is gameover
3) muk monsters, bleach throw kills multiple enemies also needs to be catched

4) Heros will come after stalling for a set amount of time and kill dragon
5) Last level wont have heroes, it's up to the janitor to save the day
6) Cleaning skills are also counted as attacking skills (i.e. Sweeping Edge)
7) Need different tools to fix different damages, but can only carry one tool at a time (maybe bad idea)
8) animated non living beings

1) platformer script

5) progressive learning
6) music and sfx
